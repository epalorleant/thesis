%\section{Introduction}
%In Chapter \ref{ch3}, we presented a model for event streams composition with quality of service. This chapter presents a distributed event composition system (DESC) that implements the proposed model as a network of operators executed by distributed event processing units.

\section{Producer}
An event producer is a component able to generate events. This can be a physical device such as a sensor, or a software component. The definition of an event producer includes its ID, a brief description, its location, and at the type of events it generates with their associate priority. A producer generates events with respect to a production rate. A production rate is defined by a probability distribution.

Producer P:= <ID, description, location, eventType, priority, productionRate>
