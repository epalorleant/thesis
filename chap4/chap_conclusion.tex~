%\textbf{Distances measures for sequences:} An important issue in measuring similarity/distance between two sequences is the ability to deal with outlying points, noise in the data, amplitude differences and the existence of gaps and other time axis distorsion problems \cite{outsurvey11}. 
%************************Conclusion***************************************************

To analyse traces of finished events, and fix bugs, programmers use several tools such as trace visualizers (\cite{paje,tracevis,vet,surv08}) and techniques such as tracepoints on the execution traces. These techniques need to have an expert to 
interpret the graphical representation. In contrast, our work based on distances develops a technique which limits the developer intervention.

There is an abundant literature about distances. For distances between sequences, an edit distance model is used in \cite{do09} to approximate matching of timed strings; \cite{kos11, gu12} propose to represent each sequence in a suitable form, before computing distance. However, very few distances take into account the temporal aspect. We propose a temporal distance that is adapted for trace comparison. But the most distinguishing point of our approach is that our method is the first, to the best of our knowledge which returns a diagnosis to the user, added to the effective values of distance.

Our approach diagnoses anomalies in an execution trace of multimedia application, by comparison with a reference trace. We use distances as models of comparison and specifically design three distinct distances in order to tackle well-known anomalies of the multimedia domain. We experimentally show the originality of our solution compared to existent distances and show that our proposed approach scales well to real huge application traces. Distances defined in our approach allow to identify a specific problem and give a semantic added-value level to the analysis. Moreover, as all distances, they also provide insights of how far an abnormal trace is from a correct one. We also present a use case on how TED performs the analysis of a trace and conduct some experiments to evaluate TED scalability and accuracy. 

We have three research directions. The first direction is to adapt our distances to abstract traces so that our proposal be as generic as possible. The second direction is to enlarge TED to other types of anomalies for instance the image is completely fuzzy, upside down and/or cut in half. The strength of our contribution is that it is easily extensible  to other types of anomalies. For each new anomaly, we only need to follow the same methodology as explained in this part to find the best suitable distance able to clearly detect the anomaly. There is no need to do any changes in TED existing architecture.  Finally, additional constraints can be introduced such as parallel execution traces and 
the challenge is to identify, for example, streams of different execution and take them into account for the computation of distances.

% Conclusion et perspectives ; c’est un résumé étendu ; rappeler le problème, les résultats connus avant la partie et la nouvelle solution proposée ; 
% donner une évaluation explicite du chemin parcouru par rapport à l'objectif annoncé dans l'introduction ; les perspectives doivent découler directement
%  et de manière naturelle du travail réalisé ; si la solution proposée n'est pas optimale, alors proposer des pointeurs pour l’exploration de meilleures
%  solutions ; si la solution est optimale alors donner des perspectives liées plutôt à la résolution d’autres problèmes connexes ou plus généraux.
