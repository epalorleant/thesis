\textit{Anomaly detection is an important topic which has considerable interest in many domains such as system failure, fraud detection, software debbuging,
or education. Another term referring to it is outlier detection \cite{Manish Gupta 2013}. There is an extensive work on sequence-based anomaly detection techniques, and particularly on those using similarity techniques.
 In this chapter, we present an overview of techniques to detect anomalies on symbolic sequences, focusing on those using similarity. We will 
go further by presenting basis techniques of distances applying on sequences. Finally, we will highlight important remaining challenge in distance 
-based techniques, tackled by this work.}

\section{Overview of existing methods for anomaly detection on sequences}
\cite{chandola 2012} in their survey reveal that existing research on anomalies detection for sequences generally focus on three problem formulations:
(i)Detect anomalous contiguous subsequences within a long sequence (contiguous subsequence-based anomaly detection); (ii)Detect anomalous sequences from a database 
of test sequences (sequence-based anomaly detection)

\section{Overview of distances on sequences}
One of the main application domains where anomaly detection techniques have been developed to handle discrete sequences is biology. According to \cite{Mantaci,2007},
 sequence comparison has become a very essential tool in modern molecular biology and similarity measures need to be able to capture the rearrangements 
involving segments contained in the sequences.
Generally, some distances are used because it is the usage in the domain. For instance, Euclidian distance for clustering in information retrieval{color{blue} To develop}.

\section{Remaining challenge}
The previous overviews show that there is an abundant literature about the subject. We provide a classification coarse classification of basis techniques 
in order to give off some remaining issues. 

\subsection{Classification}
We classify some existing distances following two requirements related to characteristics of data that we manipulate and main aspects to take into account 
with distances.
\begin{description}
 \item[ Data features] Most of data nowadays in domains concerned by anomaly detection has important characteristics which are essential to consider. 
They are mainly structured in sequences and the timestamps plays an important role. In the same manner, the huge amount is also a common element for this 
data and should be taking into account to obtain an useable technic. Finally, because the type of anomaly can differs across domains, we consider also 
multimedia aspect. 
\item[Distance features] concern the goal that a distance has to achieve. Especially, we would like to incorporate semantic in the process and we 
want to propose a diagnosis, to reveal not only that there is an anomaly, but also where it is located.

\subsection{Discussion}
Our classification \ref{tab:p2c1-class} points out the limitations of existing methods concerning the requirements that we defined.
